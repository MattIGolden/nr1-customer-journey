# Javascript Node CircleCI 2.0 configuration file
#
# Check https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/language-javascript/ for more details
#

# Notes:
# - The master branch has to have a config or it won't even see other branches
# - CircleCI requires a follower before it will build a project
# - There is a CLI for testing config schema locally - https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/#section=configuration


# 2.1 vs. 2.0 - https://discuss.circleci.com/t/circleci-2-1-config-overview/26057

# Version 2.1 moves towards a single version at the top of the file vs. under workflow
